# Specification Quality Checklist: PDF Link Reader and Prompt-to-Word Agent

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2026-03-19  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Validation performed against `spec.md` on 2026-03-19; all items pass.
- SC-001/SC-002 reference “reviewers” and a “curated test set”—`/speckit.plan` should name concrete test assets and evaluation method.
- FR-005 optional PDF-as-context: behavior is specified; planning should confirm UX (single command vs. two-step flow).
